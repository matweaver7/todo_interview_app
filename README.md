# Requirements

NODE,
NPM,
Python,
Port 7000 needs to be available

You'll also need the PYTHON environment variable set correctly.

# Installation

`npm install`

# Setup

`npm run start:dev`

# Instructions
Build a to-do app using the provided repo (this one). You need to be able to add, remove and "mark as complete" items in the todo list.

The Application's Home page can be found in `src/pages/Home/index.tsx`. This is the page where you will want to start adding your code for the app.

Required Functionality:
1. A text box where you can type in the text for a to-do item.
2. A "submit" button that adds items to the top of the to-do list when clicked.
3. A "remove" button that removes items from off the bottom of the to-do list when clicked.
4. Each to-do item should have a way of marking it as done (the checkmark in the examples). When clicked it marks the item as complete and changes the to-do items text to be crossed out.
5. Must be written in React using this repository as the base.

The order of this should operate like a queue. (FIFO)

# Customization

Look and feel of the app can be customized as much as you want as long as all of the functional requirements in the instructions are met as specified.

As an example, you can change the text of the buttons to what the most sense to you. You could also add extra functionality. Just make sure all requirements are met.

You can also add any additional npm packages that you feel you need to accomplish the project.

Let us know, either in your email or somehow in the app, if you added any extra functionality isn't super obvious so we don't miss it and can check it out.

# Helpful Information

This project is set up to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). Feel free to use the Bootstrap components and class names to help make your styling easier and more consistent.

If you want to use CSS styling, this project is set up to use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/). Plain CSS files will also work.
